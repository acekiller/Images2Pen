I've been using it since the first version was released with my first-generation iPad, and 3M Smart Pen. It was just awesome, more after adding image is supported.\r\n\r\nHowever, what I really wanted to do is get rid of heavy books or lecture notes in my backpack. There are many PDF/PPT annotation app in the App Store, but none of them satisfied me as much as Penultimate.\r\n\r\nSo I started to think, what if I can make Penultimate document on my Mac, with images rendered from PDF or PPT, put it on my iPad, and draw something on the images.\r\n\r\n# How to Use the Program\r\n\r\n\tImages2Pen  \"[imagesFolder]\" \"[title]\"\r\n\r\nThose who are not familiar with Terminal: \r\n\r\n1. Download the zip file from [Downloads][2], extract it.\r\n2. Launch Terminal.app. It may be located at /Applications/Utilites.\r\n3. Drag and drop Images2Pen onto Terminal window from Downloads folder.\r\n4. Drag and drop the folder where images are located at.\r\n5. Type a title you want to use.\r\n6. Press return.\r\n7. A pen file will be generated in the images folder. Send it to your iPad with iTunes or Dropbox.\r\n\r\n# File Format Structure\r\n\r\nCAUTION: The content below is ALSO CONSIDERED AS SOURCE CODE - SEE LICENSE.\r\n\r\nCAUTION: Notebook, Page, PageLayer, ImagePageLayer classes are not completed for any other use yet.\r\n\r\n## Layer\r\n\r\n\tNotebook *notebook\r\n\t\t- Page *page1\r\n\t\t\t- PageLayer(ImagePageLayer) *pageLayer1\r\n\t\t\t- …\r\n\t\t- Page *page2\r\n\t\t\t- PageLayer(ImagePageLayer) *pageLayer2\r\n\t\t\t- …\r\n\t\t- …\r\n\r\n## Binary\r\n\r\n\theader: 20 Bytes\r\n\r\n\t\tmetadata: NSDictionary Class Encoded With NSKeyedArchiver\r\n\r\n\t\tnotebook: Notebook Class Encoded With NSKeyedArchiver\r\n\r\n\t\t\tpage1: Page Class Encoded With NSKeyedArchiver\r\n\t\t\t\tresource1: Image Data\r\n\r\n\t\t\tpage2: Page Class Encoded With NSKeyedArchiver\r\n\t\t\t\tresource2: Image Data\r\n\r\n\t\t\t…\r\n\r\n\tfooter: NSArray Class Encoded By NSKeyedArchiver\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis entire project, source codes are under GPLv3.\r\n\r\nReally.
